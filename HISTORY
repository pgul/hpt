2. CONFIG changes:
   - area definition options -manual & -mandatory are different:

   - remove round quotes from origin & areafixorigin; for define empty origin
     set to "";

   - set 'DIR' flag in areafix's messages - prevent send areafix reports and
     requests via routing;

     flag) and contains one or more @TID kludges all of them will be
     replaced by one kludge with info about hpt;
