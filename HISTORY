HPT 1.4 stable
Changes between hpt-1.2-stable and hpt-1.4-stable

1. MAJOR feature improvements:
   - new parameter for bundlenamestyle: addrsCRC32 - for generate more unique
     bundle file names for every link pair (thanks to Igor Romanovsky);
   - Don't include Origin into areafix reply if areafixorigin is empty string;
   - reduces SEEN-BY (FSC-0093)
   - new areafix command: %rsb on/off - turns on/off reduced SEEN-BY mode.
   - @RESCANNED kludge on rescanned messages (FSC-0057)

2. CONFIG changes:
   - area definition options -manual & -mandatory are different:
     '-mandatory' prevent unsubscribe, '-manual' disable subscribe;
   - remove round quotes from origin & areafixorigin; for define empty origin
     set to "";
   - new feature: NewAreaRefuseFile - file with masks of areas which we don't
     want to autocreate;
   - new keyword: disablePID: Same as disableTID, but works only for messages
     being posted;
   - new keyword: AvailList (link section): specify variant for reply to %avail
     command.
   - ^AFLAGS NPD is now configurable via config (areafixReportsAttr)

3. IMPORTANT bugfixes:
   - deadareas.pl: Change dupebase files suffix: 'dpd' to 'dph' ('dpd' is
     obsolete);
   - do not scan messages with flag 'LOK' set;
   - If message is being scanned (i.e. has 'Loc' flag and doesn't have 'Snt'
     flag) and contains one or more @TID kludges all of them will be
     replaced by one kludge with info about hpt;
   - Posted message doesn't contain ^ATID anymore. It will be added only during
     scan;
   - Fix trap for messages with illegal date field value: begin of epoch or
     very big (<1.1.1970 and >n.n.2038)
   - Check netmailarea presence in config (before: trap)
   - ImportLog will not contain passthrough areas any more.
   - Fix CarbonCopy processing: add end of line after kludges
   - Fix linking when ^AMSGID or ^AREPLY are in MiXeD cAsE
   - keepTrsMail works now
   - If hpt is being run several times within the same second it could generate
     the same pkt name and archiver will overwrite existing pkt in bundle.
     Now before generating 1st pkt hpt make a delay in 1 second to prevent 
     this.
   - Changed zonegating algorythm (see docs)
   - Take from/to addresses from INTL instead of binary headers when packing 
     netmail from message base. If addresses from kludges not available - 
     addresses from headers will be taken.
   - Fixed bug with changing 1st line of included config file while
     autocreating area
