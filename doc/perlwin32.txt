                        Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What files does hpt need to support perl?
A: (DK)
   ActiveState Perl library (Perl56.dll) and
   MS Visual C run-time library (msvcrt.dll)

Q: I've installed libraries but perl script doesn't work. Why?
A: (DK)
   If you use system (standard) Perl modules you need Perl to be installed
   into your system (http://www.activestate.com, download and install build
   623 or above)

Q: Am I able to use another perl interpreter instead of ActiveState Perl?
A: (DK)
   Yes you can, but you should modify code by yourself like in current code.

A: (DK)
   This function is called only if other perl hooks had been called before.
