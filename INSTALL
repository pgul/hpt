Please read the files (especially README.Makefiles) in the
husky-common-package FIRST!

Unix:
-----

0. the smapi and the fidoconfig package is required for the hpt package. They
   must be already compiled and installed.
   fidoconfig version 0.9 is required.

1. Put the hpt package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconf/
                             -> hpt/

2. compile hpt

You're ready. If you have a working fidoconfig, you can now use fido under
unix.
