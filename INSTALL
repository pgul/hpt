Please read the files (especially README.Makefiles) in the
husky-common (huskybse) package FIRST! If you don't have this package you
should download it from http://husky.sourceforge.net/


Unix:
-----

0. The smapi and the fidoconfig package is required for the hpt package. They
   must be already compiled and installed.
   These libraries must be the exactly same version as hpt.

1. Put the hpt package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/husky/           -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconf/
                             -> hpt/

2. Compile smapi, fidoconf, hpt

If you use huskymak.cfg, edit it to suit your preferences and invoke:

	$ make
        (or `gmake' on some systems)
        
        $ su
        # make install
        
otherwise type
	
        $ make -f makefile.XXX
        
        where `XXX' depends on your platform and compiler 
        (refer to fidoconf/README)
        
        $ su
        # make -f makefile.XXX install
        
You're ready. Now edit your config as you need and run hpt :)


Win32, OS/2:
------------

There is a lot of win32 compilers, so refer to your compiler's manual how to
use makefiles for compiling projects.

If you already have precompiled binaries - just unpack packages, edit your
config and run hpt :)
