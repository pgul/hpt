The following things of fidoconfig are currently not implemented in HPT:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- enc / noenc is not used to route a netmail
- hub-routing does not use the hubs defined in the nodelist but uses the nodes
  aka - (aka.node %100)
  e.g.: a mail to node 2:2433/1245 is send to 2:2433/1200
  but   a mail to node 2:2433/355 is send to 2:2433/300 which currently does
        not exist. 
  BE CAREFUL!
