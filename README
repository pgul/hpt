! JAM with deleted msgs scanned without highwaters, but there is a fix in code:
  if the new msg in the end of message base, scanning will be started from this
  msg, else - from 1-st msg (new msg at the begin or if no new msg at all).
  Thats why you should always use EchoTossLog file!

Renaming suffxies:

.tos - hpt crashes on this pkt, report to developers!
.sec - pktpwd problem or link not found, bundles in unsecure inbound
.acs - could not open pkt
.bad - not/wrong pkt, bundle unpacking problems
.ntu - not to us
.err - msg tossing problem (couldn't open badArea/couldn't write msg)
.flt - perl filter (process_pkt()) returns bad retcode
