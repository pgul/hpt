TODO-List for HPT
=================

Category 1: Will certainly be implemented until next release
============================================================

- jam link, purge & pack
- real statistics - msg's and speed (max)
- check dupebase filename creation - dos & passthrough areas
- autocreate reports
- pkt's tossed to badarea not renaming to .err

Category 2: Might be implemented, but volunteers are always very welcome!
=========================================================================

- hpt should sort pkts in the inbound directories in order of the date/time.
  So older pkts are processed before newer ones.
- several netmail areas

Category 3: Will only be included if volunteers send patches
============================================================

- divide hpt into several programs:
  tosser
  packer
  scanner
  poster
  linker
  areafix
- zone-gating
- nodelist access
- real hub-routing

Category 4: Will not be implemented
===================================
